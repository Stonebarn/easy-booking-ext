## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- Initial release.
- `content-nooks.js`: captures the current prospect's email from the Nooks
  dialer by anchoring on the "Email" contact-card label, with mailto and
  visible-text fallbacks; stores it in `chrome.storage.local`.
- `content-scheduler.js`: auto-fills the booking form email input on
  `scheduler.default.com` using a React-safe value setter; skips stale
  (>30 min) captures and never overwrites a value the rep already typed.
- `popup.html` / `popup.js`: shows the captured email and a manual "Fill now".
- `background.js`: minimal MV3 service worker.
- `scripts/validate.mjs`: manifest + referenced-file validator (used by CI).
